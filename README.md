OVERVIEW OF PROJECT 

PORTFOLIO WEBSITE REDESIGN
Redesign your personal portfolio website to showcase your work and skills in a visually
appealing and user-friendly manner. Focus on improving the layout, navigation, and
visual design to create a professional and engaging user experience.

I undertook a comprehensive redesign of my personal portfolio website to better showcase my work and skills. 
Using Figma, I focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly design that emphasizes a professional and engaging user experience. 
I improved the layout and navigation to ensure visitors can easily explore my projects and learn about my expertise. 
By leveraging Figma's design and prototyping tools, I was able to create a seamless and interactive prototype that brings my vision to life, 
demonstrating my proficiency in modern design techniques and my commitment to delivering a high-quality user experience.
